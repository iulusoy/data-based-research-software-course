# Compact course: AI in research software - best practices for developing and using ML models

The AI revolution is moving even more rapidly than the digital revolution and leads to the emergence of completely new tools and technologies that affect the scientific process. In this course, we will learn about data-based research software, tools and communities that are relevant in creating and sharing such software, and about best practices in training machine-learning models. Research software that is based on ML models requires an additional layer of best practices in the implementation, including testing of non-deterministic processes. Security aspects as well as bad examples are discussed to highlight the importance of adhering to a best practices code of conduct.

# Learning objectives
After the course participants will be able to
- Understand and follow best practices about preparing a dataset for training and testing
- Understand and follow best practices in training ML models
- Including appropriate tests in machine-learning based research software (MLBRS)
- Avoid negative impact from legal and security issues
- Know how to use appropriate checklist when publishing results that are based on ML approaches

# Prerequisites
A GitHub user account, basic Python knowledge and knowledge about data processing, ML models and training of models is required.
